For [JuliaCon 2022](https://juliacon.org/2022/). A short presentation of my
Julia package [JCheck.jl](/pages/libraries/#jcheck). Since the meeting was
virtual, a recording of this talk will be available soon.

# Accounting for Epistasis in PRSs Through the Coalescent
\begin{equation*}
L({\color{#e65100} \varphi^*} | H_0^*, {\color{#9558b2} \Phi}) \propto f(H_0^*, {\color{#9558b2} \Phi^*})
= \int_{\mathrlap{\color{#4d7e65} \mathcal G_{H_0^*}}} f({\color{#e65100} \varphi^*}, {\color{#9558b2} \Phi} | {\color{#4d7e65} G}) g({\color{#4d7e65} G}) \text d {\color{#4d7e65} G}
\end{equation*}

For the 2022 annual meeting of the Statistical Society of Canada. Joint work
with [Fabrice Larribe](http://fabricelarribe.uqam.ca/). This project is
motivated by the need to account for epistasis (SNP-SNP interaction) in
[polygenic risk scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygenic_score). We
introduce a framework for "model-free" phenotypical prediction based on genomic
data.
